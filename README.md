#  Anomaly Detection in Financial Transactions

This project uses a machine learning model (Isolation Forest & Z-score) to detect anomalies in financial transactions. It includes:

-  **Jupyter Notebook** for building and training anomaly detection models (Isolation Forest & Z-score)
-  **Power BI Dashboard** for interactive visualization of detected anomalies
-  **Dataset**: `transactions.csv` – Sample data containing transaction details
-  **Generated Financial Anomaly Audit Report** – A concise summary report highlighting suspicious or anomalous transactions based on the model’s output
  

##  Files Included
- `Anomaly_Detection.ipynb`: Python code for anomaly detection
- `transactions.csv`: Sample dataset
- `AnomalyDashboard.pbix`: Interactive dashboard built in Power BI
- Generated financial anomaly audit report

##  Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)
- Power BI for dashboarding
- GitHub for version control
